# Intro

Heya,

This plugin will act at himself, there is no permission, he will lock the loot crates that are dropped from tank or heli when they get down, they are locked to whomever made the most damage on it.
It will pop up in chat a message to everyone, that will inform who did the most damage and who can loot the crates.
